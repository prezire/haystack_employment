      <h5>
        For a job seeker, here's the big question similar to 
        the chicken and egg problem --"How can I get experience 
        when employers don't give me the opportunity to get one"?
      </h5>
      <p>
        Well, the answer is simple. Apply for an Internship. 
        Of course, it's up to your employer whether he'll give you 
        a salary. Perform well and you'll get rewarded 
        through praises from employers, managers and academe personnels. 
        Use these praises as good points when applying for a 
        job you like.

      <h5>
        I need my colleagues, university faculty members and such to give me comments.
      </h5>
      <p>
        Ask them to register as a <a href="<?php echo site_url('auth/register#subscriber'); ?>">Subscriber</a>
        for them to give you comments and feedbacks about your performance.

      <h5>What is Applicant Pooling</h5>
      <p>
        This feature is specific for employers. It's similar to
        bookmarks that allows them to organize applicants. It 
        contains a Note field to enter details such as date hired,
        performance or plans about such applicants.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h5>What are Comments?</h5>

        These are praises, inputs, feedbacks from employer, 
        Subscribers such as managers and academe personnels based on an applicant's 
        performance when they undergo the applied position. Applicants can use 
        these items as their reference when applying for another job.

        These are the records of the open positions that the applicant 
        has applied.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h5>As an applicant, where can I find vacant positions</h5>
      <p>
        Go to the <a href="<?php echo site_url('main'); ?>">home page</a>. 
        You can then either search for keywords or locate "For Applicants" tab.

            public profile. Use the Forward button to send the URL to specific employers</li>

      <h5>What's the answer to the chicken and egg problem?</h5>
      <p>
        The egg came first. Billions of years of evolution where 
        micro organisms transform into something far better species. 
        In order to protect themselves while evolving, they need 
        some kind of protection much like a cocoon for butterflies 
        or a shell for snails. Perfecting that egg evolution, 
        comes out a chicken.
